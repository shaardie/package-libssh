Package: libssh-4
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Multi-Arch: same
Description: tiny C SSH library (OpenSSL flavor)
 The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working SSH
 implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the client
 is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs,
 transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs.
 With its SFTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily.
 .
 This package contains shared libraries linked against OpenSSL.
